### Setting up Rinkby

This isn't necessary for local deployment, but eventually you'll want to
test on a semi-real test network.

1. Create an account at [Infura](https://infura.io)
2. Create a new mnemonic with the following command:
    ```shell script
    npx mnemonics
    ```

3. Create a secrets file at `secrets.json` with the following structure:

    ```json
    {
      "mnemonic": "some great words ...",
      "mnemonicProd": "some better words ...",
      "projectId": "12345abcde",
      "projectSecret": "abcde12345"
    }
    ```

### Build and deploy

```shell script
npx oz create
```
